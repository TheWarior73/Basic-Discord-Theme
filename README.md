> Hello Everyone ! I am working on this side project on my spare time and would gladly apreciate any help, this is my first time putting a theme together and it is quite messy, working with css is not my strong point either and as you will see it is really junky, this is why I am in the need of some help to contribute to this theme !

## The theme
This theme was made for personal use but as some of my friends were intrested in it, I figured i'd make it available for everybody to use and upgrade !

This theme is a simple discord classic theme with colors changes, nothing fancy or revolutionary but its colors are all customizable etc, the more time passes, the more it will recieve updates to fix existing bugs and add new features (hopefully)

## Contributing
Feel free to help with the developement of the theme !   
Here is a quick list of features that are yet to be added, if you feel like contributing to one of them, please start a pull request !

- Porting to a local and distant file for updates and vencord Online Themes feature
- Sorting the css into multiple files
- Fix the User popout backgrounds
- Fix weird box-shadows
- Fix all the missed pannels (i.e The shop (useless but you get the idea))
- i m p r o v e the c̵̫̀̊̇̍ ụ̴̤͎̂̈́͂ r̴̀̂͌̃ͅ s̸̢͚̪͕͕̓̈́̾ ẻ̵̡̼ d̵̬̯͇̋͗̐͑͜ css

Suggest more things because i'm bad at making todo lists when i don't know what i'm searching for
